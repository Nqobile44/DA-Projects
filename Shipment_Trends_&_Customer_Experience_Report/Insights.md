## **Summary Insights (Storytelling)**

Imagine a bustling e-commerce network dispatching thousands of packages daily by **flight**, **road**, and **ship**. Across every shipping mode, the majority of orders consistently arrive on time — with **ships handling the lion’s share** of timely deliveries.

When we zoom into warehouse operations, **Warehouse Block A** leads in volume, but timely deliveries are robust across all warehouse blocks. Surprisingly, **product importance influences delivery punctuality** — low-importance items are delivered on time far more often than high-importance ones.

Weight plays its part: **heavier packages tend to be late**, while lighter ones reach customers more reliably. Interestingly, **customer care calls and ratings have minimal effect on timely deliveries**, suggesting that service quality is steady regardless of issues raised.

Customers spend about **$200–$250 per shipment**, and spend slightly more when deliveries arrive late, regardless of gender. Lastly, whether a customer buys once or ten times, their ratings and delivery experiences stay remarkably consistent.

In short: **On-time delivery is the norm, weight is a key disruptor, and spending trends stay stable — a healthy sign of operational reliability.**
